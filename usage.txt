to use IJVM you must : 

1) load microprogram (IJVM) written in mal, which can be found under the mal folder (.mci1 extension)

2) compile your IJVM .jas file, and then you must compile it as macroprogram (compiling to a .ijvm extension)

3) execute your .ijvm file which was produced in this case, skipping a macro step at a time
